# Lab4 Rubric (Total Point 50)
In general, no matter which method they are using, give them full points as long as result looks fine.

## Part 1: Scaling (21)
### 2.1 Question 1.1 (3)
#### select the correct column for Female Adult Literacy (1)
#### select the correct column for Gross National Income Per Capita (1)
#### create a new dataframe containing the two columns (order DOSEN'T matter) (1)
#### drop NaN rows (optional)

### 2.2 Question 1.2 (3)
order of plots do not matter. They can be stacked vertically or horizontally.
#### plot for Female Adult Literacy (1.5)
order of country names in the plot dosen't matter, as long as the values seem correct would be fine.
No need to strictly match the plot in the template.
#### plot for Gross National Income Per Capita (1.5)
order of country names in the plot dosen't matter, as long as the values seem correct would be fine.
No need to strictly match the plot in the template.


### 2.3 Question 1.3 (2)
reasonable answer that mentions the limitation of histogram (works with numerical data in both axis),
and the country name is nominal data.

### 2.4 Question 1.4 (3)
order of plots do not matter. They can be stacked vertically or horizontally.
#### plot for Female Adult Literacy (1.5)
order of country names in the plot dosen't matter, as long as the values seem correct would be fine.
No need to strictly match the plot in the template.
#### plot for Gross National Income Per Capita (1.5)
order of country names in the plot dosen't matter, as long as the values seem correct would be fine.
No need to strictly match the plot in the template.

### 2.5 Question 1.5 (3)
order of plots do not matter. They can be stacked vertically or horizontally.
#### plot for Female Adult Literacy (1.5)
No need to strictly match the plot in the template, as long as the values seem correct.
#### plot for Gross National Income Per Capita (1.5)
No need to strictly match the plot in the template, as long as the values seem correct.

### 2.6 Question 1.6 (2)
order of plots do not matter. They can be stacked vertically or horizontally.
#### plot for Female Adult Literacy (1)
No need to strictly match the plot in the template, as long as the values seem correct.
#### plot for Gross National Income Per Capita (1)
No need to strictly match the plot in the template, as long as the values seem correct.

### 2.7 Question 1.7 (2)
order of plots do not matter. They can be stacked vertically or horizontally.
#### plot for Female Adult Literacy (1)
No need to strictly match the plot in the template, as long as the values seem correct.
#### plot for Gross National Income Per Capita (1)
No need to strictly match the plot in the template, as long as the values seem correct.

### 2.8 Question 1.8 (3)
#### logarithmic transformation of data (2)
check code if plot is not correct for this part.
#### plot for Gross National Income Per Capita (1)
No need to strictly match the plot in the template, as long as the values seem correct.
If the plot does not seem correct, check if logarithmic is correct. If the logarithmic transform
is wrong, but the plot is consistent with the wrongly transformed value, then give points for plotting

## Part 2: Kernel Density Estimation (24)
### 4.1 Question 2.1
#### function implementation (2)
can directly check correctness by the plot
### 4.2 Question 2.2 (3)
students can use for loop, numpy array, or just manually copy code for each plotting. As long as the
plot values match the one in template would be good.
Just need to check the plot values. The axis limit and other plot details don't need to be strict.
#### use gaussian kernel separately for each datapoint (2)
can check code if the plot seems wrong to make sure students actually used gaussian kernel for each datapoint
#### plot distributions in the same axis (1)

### 4.3 Question 2.3 (4)
#### sum of all kernels (2)
#### normalize after sum (check value range for this part) (1)
#### plot matches the one in the template (1)
don't have to strictly match, just check if value seems reasonable.

### 4.4 Question 2.4 (1)
#### plot as before in Question 1.8 (check template) (1)

### 4.5 Question 2.5 (6)
#### logarithmic transform of the datapoint (2)
#### sum of all kernels (2)
#### normalize after sum (check value range for this part) (1)
#### tuned alpha so that plot matches the one in the template (1)
don't need to be strict, as long as shape looks similar will be fine

### 4.6 Question 2.6 (6)
#### used the kernel argument passed to compute KDE (1)
#### sum of all kernels (2)
#### normalize after sum (1)
#### other correctness (2)
can check template for correctness

### 4.7 Question 2.7 (2)
#### compare and contrast Gaussian and Boxcar kernels. Any reasonable answers will get full mark.
